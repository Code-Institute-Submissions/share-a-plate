## Design 

  ### Colour Scheme

  To choose the colour scheme for the project I read some articles on colour and it's use in food,
  to get a better understanding of the relationship of colours and food. The main information I 
  gathered from these articles was to avoid dark colder colours. That is why I've tried to use bright
  shades of colours, not too bright to affect readability but a shade brighter than I would normally use.

  If you would like to read the articles referred to you can find them below:

  ![My Colour Palette](/static/images/color-palette.png)
  I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help generate my Colour Palette

  ### Typography

  I have used [Inknut Antiqua](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua?query=Inknut+Antiqua) for the Headings and Nav links
  and [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?sidebar.open=true) for the content of the project. I really think these fonts 
  work well together

  I've created the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq Wireframes

To implement the use of CSS Counter I read [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_counters.asp) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters) tutorials and explanation on using the CSS Variable

To create the back button on the full_recipe and 404 pages I followed Niel McEwen jquery events in jquery tutorials in the Interactive Frontend Development module of [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) Full Stack Software Development course
I also used [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_history.asp) tutorial on these buttons.

To help with implementing the /admin_page checks to allow admins access to higher righs I have been tutored by Shane Murphy
He helped me understand the use of the session variable. His tutoring helped me set the is_superuser check to allow users with admin privaleges access to the admin page
